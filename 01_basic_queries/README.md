# 🛠️ Foundational SQL Queries

This folder contains fundamental SQL script examples demonstrating my proficiency in querying, filtering, and summarizing data. These scripts represent the essential building blocks for data extraction and preliminary analysis.

## 🎯 Key Skills Demonstrated

The queries within this directory primarily focus on the following foundational SQL concepts:

* **Data Retrieval (`SELECT` and `FROM`):** Extracting specific columns and tables needed for analysis.
* **Filtering Data (`WHERE` and `LIKE`):** Applying conditions to narrow down results and focus on relevant subsets of data.
* **Grouping and Aggregation (`GROUP BY` and Aggregate Functions):** Calculating summary statistics (e.g., `SUM`, `AVG`, `COUNT`) to derive insights from data groups.
* **Ordering Results (`ORDER BY`):** Structuring the final output for readability and better analysis.

## 📁 File Contents

Each `.sql` file in this directory is commented to explain the query's objective and the underlying data logic.

* `case_practices1.sql`: Example queries showing basic SELECT, FROM, WHERE, and ORDER BY usage.
